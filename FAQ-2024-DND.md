# D&D 2024 and the Foundry D&D 5e v4.x FAQ

## What versions support 2024 content?

You will need to upgrade the Foundry D&D system to 4.x+, and DDB Importer to 6.x+ to import the 2024 content.

## I don't want to import 2024 content

If you stay on the 3.x D&D System and 5.x DDB Importer you will not get 2024 content (mostly). As off now there is no filter to remove 2024 content during import in the 6.x version of the DDB Importer systme. This may come at a later date.

## So 2024 is fully implemented for import?

No. Please see this [Known Issues list](https://github.com/MrPrimate/ddb-importer/issues/505)

The big issues that might be stopping you upgrading straight away are:

- No character imports into compendiums (class/features/species/background etc)
- Monsters may pick up 2024 versions of spells.
- Many 2024 character features have not been tested, and there are a number of missing icons for features.
- If you run a high automation game, many of the automation modules are not yet compatible.

# Can I still import adventures?

Yes, any adventure listed in [the status page](https://docs.ddb.mrprimate.co.uk/status.html) can still be imported.

# When will the PHB 2024 be ready for Adventure Muncher?

Hopefully by the end of September.
